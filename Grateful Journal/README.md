###The Grateful Journal.

This is a simple web app inspired by a similar app that records grateful data entries. This web app is not for sale or for commercial purposes.

The web app shows how we can utilise a Google Spreadsheet as a database for small amounts of data.

Visit https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxSRTvHohaCEl1O5jdTJao856NjsAVMvxCh9Agi_s6OF2m_2so/exec to use the application. As is standard, the application asks for permission to manage your Google Sheets. This is because the web app creates a private spreadsheet for the user that only the user has access to. The script records a URL reference to the spreadsheet to open and read/write from it when the user is logged in. However, no grateful data entries are recorded anywhere else as can be seen in the code.
