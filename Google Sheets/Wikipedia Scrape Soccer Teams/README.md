###Wikipedia Scrape Soccer Teams

The request on from a Reddit user was to help with scraping all the soccer teams who were founded at least 100 years or before. I found that the data was available on Wikipedia pages for each year from 1890. Since '100 years old' was the request, we only required teams from 1890 - 1916.

The following Apps Script scrapes each wikipedia page and writes the Year and the Team to a spreadsheet.
