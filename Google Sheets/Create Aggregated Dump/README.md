###Create Aggregated Dump

A reddit user requested help to aggregate all of the data he had split across multiple tabs in a Google Spreadsheet. The data was in the same format across each sheet and he needed it all in one tab. This would take a long time to do manually and furthermore, he would need to keep adding seperate sheets and then manually add them to a master sheet as well. To add to this, the data needed to be sorted by the sheet names.

The function can be run from the Aggregation menu in the toolbar.
